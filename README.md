## Bryce-Hadl Professional Portfolio
- My goal for my portfolio was to use sample ideas I formed from past projects to create a semi-basic resume with functioning buttons.
- It built my portfolio kind of based of like the 2012 frame of a facebook account, it might be easy to tell.
- This portfolio shows my basic info and some the projects I worked on through the years in obtaining my Applied Science Degree.
- I learned how to properly write my classes and semantics for html while also setting my functions and styles for css.
